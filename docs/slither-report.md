# Slither Static Analysis Report

## Result Summary

Slither completed against the Foundry project after the OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.x and Chainlink VRF adapter migration. The analyzer exits non-zero because it reports documented design findings; no finding is left unreviewed.

The implementation changes made for the analysis pass:

- replaced local owner/pause/reentrancy code with OpenZeppelin `Ownable`, `Pausable`, and `ReentrancyGuard`
- replaced the local demo token with OpenZeppelin `ERC20`
- replaced hand-written ERC-20 transfer calls with `SafeERC20`
- added `nonReentrant` to randomness retry and raffle draw entry points
- explicitly initialized `finalizeRaffle` slashing accumulator
- added `ChainlinkVRFCoordinatorAdapter` for production-style VRF v2.5 requests
- added a 500-entry raffle cap to bound finalization gas
- added batch raffle seed reveal and paged raffle entry reads

## Residual Findings

| Detector | Status | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arbitrary-send-eth` / low-level ETH call | Accepted | The platform must pay arbitrary winners and refund reveal bonds. Payout functions are `nonReentrant` through external entry points, and state is updated before payout. |
| `reentrancy-*` around payment collection and coordinator calls | Mitigated | User-facing entry points are guarded by OpenZeppelin `nonReentrant`. Coordinator callbacks are restricted by `onlyCoordinator`, and stale request ids are ignored. |
| `timestamp` | Accepted | Raffle close times, reveal windows, and retry windows are explicitly time-based requirements. Outcomes use VRF plus committed seeds, not timestamps. |
| `reentrancy-events` in mock and Chainlink adapter fulfillment | Accepted | Fulfillment state is written before the callback is forwarded. The event after callback is an audit trail, not an authorization gate. |
| Chainlink adapter request write after external coordinator call | Accepted | Chainlink returns the request id from `requestRandomWords`; the adapter can only store request metadata after that call. Real fulfillment is asynchronous and restricted by Chainlink `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus`. |
| `missing-inheritance` against `IVRFMigratableConsumerV2Plus` | Accepted | The game contract intentionally does not inherit Chainlink consumer interfaces. Chainlink-specific logic is isolated in `ChainlinkVRFCoordinatorAdapter`, while the game depends only on the local `IRandomnessCoordinator` boundary. |
| OpenZeppelin / Chainlink pragma version noise | Accepted | Third-party packages use compatible `^0.8.x` constraints; Foundry pins compilation to Solidity `0.8.26`. |

## Follow-Up Before Real Deployment

- Use `ChainlinkVRFCoordinatorAdapter` for testnet/mainnet deployments and keep `MockVRFCoordinator` only for local demos.
- Run Slither in CI and fail on new high-confidence findings.
- Add Echidna or Medusa invariants for solvency and one-shot settlement.
- Use a multisig/timelock owner for parameter changes.
